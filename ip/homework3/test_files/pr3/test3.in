The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates
 a bubble like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause
 is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of
 interstellar wind; it extends out to the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, 
which is believed to be the source for long period comets, may also exist at a distance
roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in 
	the Orion Arm, 26,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way.
