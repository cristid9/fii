The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years 
ago from the gravitational collapse of a 
giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast
 majority of the system's mass is in the Sun,
 with most of the remaining mass contained in 
Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury,
Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, 
being primarily composed of rock and metal. The
 four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially
 more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest,
 Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed
 mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost
 planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being 
composed mostly of substances with relatively high
 melting points compared with hydrogen and helium,
 called ices, such as water, ammonia and methane. All
 planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a 
nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.
